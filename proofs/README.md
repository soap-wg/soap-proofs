## Proofs

As the proofs can take a significant amount of time, we did not prove all lemmas in one file, and as such, have multiple proof files.
The following table lists which source files contains proofs for which lemma in which model source file.

| Source file | Lemmas | Model File |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `SocialAuthentication.spthy` | `SocialAuthentication` | `signal-oidc.spthy` |
| `Executability.spthy` | `Executability` | `signal-oidc.spthy` |
| `Auxiliary.spthy` | All lemmas marked as `sources` or `reuse` | `signal-oidc.spthy` |
| `Privacy.spthy` | `Observational_equivalence`, `Executability` | `signal-oidc-priv.spthy` |
